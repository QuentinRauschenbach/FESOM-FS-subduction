## ðŸŒŠ Project Overview

This repository is part of an ongoing PhD project investigating the subduction of Atlantic Water (AW) in **Fram Strait**, with a focus on **submesoscale dynamics** and their role in vertical exchange and transformation processes. 
I will investigate properties along Lagrangian pathways created with OceanParcels(?) and high-resolution model outputs from **FESOM** (Finite-Element Sea Iceâ€“Ocean Model) and **ROMS** (Regional Ocean Modeling System)
